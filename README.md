# 🩺 MedCareBot — AI Medical Chatbot with RAG, Hugging Face & LangChain

**MedCareBot** is an AI-powered medical chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer disease-related queries based on trusted medical documents. It combines cutting-edge technologies like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, and semantic search to support healthcare professionals and patients with quick, contextual information — all wrapped in a clean Streamlit interface.
